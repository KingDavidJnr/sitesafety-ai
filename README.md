# Construction Site Safety Prediction Model 🏗️👷‍♂️

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based predictive safety framework for accident prevention on construction sites in Lagos, Nigeria. The model analyzes various site conditions and safety parameters to predict the likelihood of accidents, helping site managers take preventive measures.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Synthetic data generation mimicking real construction site conditions
- Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Comprehensive model evaluation and interpretation
- Interactive visualizations for data analysis
- Feature importance analysis for decision-making support

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- Python 3.8+
- Key libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, shap
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## 📊 Data Features
The model considers various factors including:
- Time and weather conditions
- Worker experience and safety compliance
- Equipment usage
- Site location
- Historical accident data
- Supervision status
